            This is where it all began! Back in 2011 was where the father and
            son duo started helping and where the co-founder, Theordore, would
            spend his summers as a child. The project initially started small
            with providing food and building an artesian well for the locals but
            then we saw how so many children were missing out on an education in
            a country where only 20% of eligible children for secondary school
            are enrolled. Our goal now is to partner with local nonprofits and
            the government to initiate the process of building a school for the
            village of Dubedou. When building the school, the impact is not only
            the children who will receive a formal education but the community
            and the jobs that will be provided during this process. Students
            from local universities will also have access to good paying jobs as
            they come on as teachers.
